# Terraform Build Labs
## What is a build lab?
A build lab walks you through how to complete a task. It includes all the information you need to build the desired outcome and provides additional resources for your own learning. A build lab is designed to give you hands on experience with a new technology and will help to develop foundational knowledge of a topic

## What is in the labs?
Each lab contains a README detailing the task, with code snippets that you can use. There are links to relevant documentation and some labs include an extension if you want to develop your knowledge further. Ensure that you follow the correct labs for you device type.
- If you are using a dev mac, ensure you follow the build labs under the dev-mac-labs folder
- If you are using a win365 device, ensure you follow the build labs under the win365-folder
