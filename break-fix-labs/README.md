# Terraform Break Fix Labs
## What is a break fix lab?
A break fix lab is a debugging task where you are provided some code that currently doesn't run or act as we expect it to. Your task is to fix the code so that it runs and achieves the desired outcome. Break fix labs are designed to test your knowledge of the syntax and how the code executes as you will need a good understanding of this to fix the code.

## What is in the labs?
Each lab contains the broken code and a README detailing the task, the outcome and how to run the current code.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin the lab you will need to clone this repository locally.
